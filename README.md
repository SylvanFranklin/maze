# Maze

A simple learning project I built with sveltekit. I have since greatly improved my typescript, but lack the time and energy to refactor this codebase. Recursive maze generation is mostly working, but not to a level that I find satisfactory. I may one day revisit this project, but for now it is not going anywhere. Not indented for mobile use, severe lack of media queries.

Tailwind, Typescript, and Svelte is pretty much the extent of it. Hosted on firebase at sylvansmaze.web.app
